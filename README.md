# Guru SP Site

## Setup

First of all you need to have Ruby installed (we recommended the latest version). In the Jekyll site you can find [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Ruby in your machine.

With Ruby installed follow these steps to run Guru SP in your machine:

* `gem install jekyll bundler`
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Now the Guru SP must be running at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`. When you need to run the local server again just run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
